# AngularLibrary
To learn Angular and Typescript I self-taught myself to build a library with HTTP requests to collect data from the Azure (Microsoft) cloud.

Utilized a library called reactive extensions which allows us to fetch the data from a backend service using the observable pattern.

The data.service.ts file includes code that is capable of making server side calls instead of simply returning hard coded array of books.

Note: This Webapplication is done with the latest Angular.
